As sample size grows, the standard deviation of each model reduces since more samples in training should allow for a better understanding of the overall process.When one needs to fit a regression model using a small training sample they should opt for ridge since it performs relatively well on the training set but does well to prevent overfitting with a small sample size on the test set."

    "Due to occasional system crashes, some of the bike counts reported in the data set have been recorded manually. These counts are not very unreliable and are prone to errors. It is known that roughly 5% of the labels in the training set are erroneous (i.e. can be arbitrarily different from the true counts), while all the labels in the test set were confirmed to be accurate. Unfortunately, the identities of the erroneous records in the training set are not available. Can this information about presence of 5% errors in the training set labels (without details about the specific identities of the erroneous rows) be used to improve the performance of the model in Part (g)? Note that we are interested in improving the $R^2$ performance of the model on the test set (not the training $R^2$ score). \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final task, we require you to come up with a strategy to fit a regression model, taking into account the errors in the training set labels. Explain the intuition behind your approach (we do not expect a detailed mathematical justification). Use your approach to fit a regression model on the training set, and compare its test $R^2$ with the model in Part (g).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Again, we do not require you to implement a new regression solver for handling erroneous labels. It is sufficient that you to come up with an approach that uses existing built-in functions. Your regression model may use the same polynomial terms used in Part (g)."

However, taking such an approach means we actually use the data with errors to run a model which will bias our coefficients and may lead us to pick out observations that were actually recorded accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative and better methodology that avoids having to look at residuals (which isn't a good method since the training set is influenced by the 5%) is to iteratively train the model by leaving 1 observation out and using backward selection on the observations to determine the best test R^2 with 5% of 331 =16 of the worst features removed."
